## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Struct System**: `@struct` decorator for immutable data classes, `@trait` for polymorphic dispatch.
- **Monadic Types**: `Result`, `Option`, `Validated`, `Many`, `Effect`.
- **Logic Combinators**: Rich functional utilities (`compose`, `check`, `when`, `where`) and placeholder expression syntax (`_`).
- **Operand Decorators**: `@cases` for sum types, `@safe` (as_result, as_option) for error handling integration.
- **Integration**: Pipeline operator support (`>>`) across all major types.
- **Testing**: Complete test suite with 100% coverage (730 passing tests).
- **Concurrency**: `concurrent` module for parallel execution.

### Changed
- Refactored core modules to ensure `mypy --strict` compliance.
- Consolidated error handling patterns around `Result` monad.

### Security
- Initial release with scoped strictness; no known vulnerabilities.
